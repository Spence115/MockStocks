## Description

This simulated stock trading web app is built using Python, Flask, HTML, Jinja, SQLite3, and CSS. It uses real market data from [IEX](https://www.iexexchange.io/products/market-data-connectivity) to enable users to "buy" and "sell" stocks with a default account balance of $10,000 (not actual currency, for demonstration only).

Key features of the app include:

  *	“Buying” and “selling” shares
  *	Portfolio summary of user's holdings
  *	Comprehensive transaction history
  *	Stock price quotes
  *	User account creation, login, and logout
  *	Password checking for new user accounts
  *	Error messages displayed as generated memes 

All financial information is stored in the <kbd>finance.db</kbd> database, with the database schema documented in the comments of the <kbd>app.py</kbd> file.
